			<p>D12 (12th floor of 6 E 16 Street New York) is home to Design and Technology students. Students go up to D12 hoping to work in a peaceful, studious and clean environment. Although D12 has remained clean, our project proposal focuses on establishing that even further while successfully implementing an environment friendly recycling bin. Our goal is to install an interactive Recycling Bin, in DT Style, that not only will engage users to recycle more but will have them feeling better about themselves with the comical dialogue that’s emitted from the robot-like recycling bin.</p>
			<p>On the recycling bin, a replicated head of Sven (the legendary founder of our program) has two blinking eyes staring at people passing by, to catch the curiosity of using the bin for recycling. An IR motion sensor is placed inside of the bin to detect any recycling materials. Once the IR sensor is triggered, the replicated head will open its mouse, controlled by a servo, and Sven’s dialogue will be played through the Music.</p>
